I‚Äôm currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science in IIOT Lab, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I have the honor to be supervised by [Prof. Luoyi Fu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fu-ly/index.html) and [Prof. Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).

My research interest includes **graph representation learning** and **recommender systems**.
